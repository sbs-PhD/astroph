This repository This repository was created to keep the code referenced in a paper submitted for publication in a scientific journal.

## Introduction and notes

There are some helper functions wrote to plot resources and and computing features. I import the following Python Modules:

1. NumPy (version 1.18.0) - https://numpy.org/
2. SciPy (version 1.4.0) - https://www.scipy.org/
3. Scikit-learn (version 0.23.2) - https://scikit-learn.org/
4. XGBoost (version 1.1.0) - https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xgboost-nightly-builds/list.html?prefix=release_1.0.0/
5. imbalance-learn (version 0.6.0) - https://pypi.org/project/imbalanced-learn/0.6.0/

Python version 3.8.1 see documentation https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.1/

After install, run _benchmark.py_ code to check if all its ok.
